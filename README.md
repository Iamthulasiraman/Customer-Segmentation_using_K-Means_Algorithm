# Customer-Segmentation_using_K-Means_Algorithm

In marketing, market segmentation is the process of dividing a broad consumer or business market, normally consisting of existing sub-groups of consumed potential customers, into (known as segments) based on some type of shared characteristics. Customer Segmentation is the most important applications of unsupervised learning 

What to do in this Project?

1)Perform data exploration

2)Perform data transformations

3)Perform data modelling using k-Means Algorithm

4)Perform elbow method to identify the optimal number of clusters

5)Perform data modelling using multiple clustering algorithms

6)Perform comparison of different ML algorithms and choose the best clustering algorithm
